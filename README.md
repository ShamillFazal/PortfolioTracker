# Crypto Portfolio Tracker

Welcome to the Crypto Portfolio Tracker! This project is a web application designed to track and display the native and ERC-20 token balances associated with a user-inputted wallet address. The inspiration behind this project stems from my passion for blockchain and web3 technologies, driven by years of involvement in the crypto space. I embarked on building this app not only to enhance my coding skills but also to create a tool that aligns with my interest in cryptocurrency.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP of the Crypto Portfolio Tracker includes an application that showcases both native and ERC-20 token balances for a specified wallet address. The app supports several prominent EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains. The tech stack for this project comprises React, Vite, Express, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS. Data is pulled through the Moralis API, a service that simplifies and accelerates the development of decentralized applications.

## Features and Further Development

In the future, I plan to expand the capabilities of the Crypto Portfolio Tracker by incorporating additional features. Some of the proposed enhancements include:
- Fiat on/off ramp through third-party services.
- Integration of token charts for a visual representation of token performance.

## Challenges and Learning

Throughout the development process, I encountered various challenges and valuable learning experiences. One notable hurdle was related to displaying NFT (Non-Fungible Token) images. Due to the diverse and often unstructured nature of NFT metadata, achieving a seamless display presented difficulties, especially with older NFTs.

I also gained insights into responsive design, adapting elements to display optimally on both desktop and mobile devices. For instance, I modified the presentation of data tables on mobile devices for better user experience.
