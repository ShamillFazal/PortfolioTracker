# PortfolioTracker
Crypto portfolio dashboard project.

## MVP ##

The MVP will be consist of an app that dislays both the native & erc-20 token balances of a user inputted wallet address. The App will Support several prominent EVM chains.

The tech stack for the app will be React, Vite, Express, Node & Tailwind CSS (most likely) & will pull data through Moralis API.

## Further Development ## 

I aim to add several features to the project overtime including Fiat on/off ramp through third parties and possible token charts.

## Notes ##

I am building this app to further my coding skills and also for fun as I really enjoy both coding and crypto! ðŸ˜„
